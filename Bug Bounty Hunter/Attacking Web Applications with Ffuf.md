# Introduction

* * *

Welcome to the `Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf` module!

There are many tools and methods to utilize for directory and parameter fuzzing/brute-forcing. In this module we will mainly focus on the [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) tool for web fuzzing, as it is one of the most common and reliable tools available for web fuzzing.

The following topics will be discussed:

- Fuzzing for directories
- Fuzzing for files and extensions
- Identifying hidden vhosts
- Fuzzing for PHP parameters
- Fuzzing for parameter values

Tools such as `ffuf` provide us with a handy automated way to fuzz the web application's individual components or a web page. This means, for example, that we use a list that is used to send requests to the webserver if the page with the name from our list exists on the webserver. If we get a response code 200, then we know that this page exists on the webserver, and we can look at it manually.


# Web Fuzzing

* * *

We will start by learning the basics of using `ffuf` to fuzz websites for directories. We run the exercise in the question below, and visit the URL it gives us, and we see the following website:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_main_site.jpg)

The website has no links to anything else, nor does it give us any information that can lead us to more pages. So, it looks like our only option is to ' `fuzz`' the website.

* * *

## Fuzzing

The term `fuzzing` refers to a testing technique that sends various types of user input to a certain interface to study how it would react. If we were fuzzing for SQL injection vulnerabilities, we would be sending random special characters and seeing how the server would react. If we were fuzzing for a buffer overflow, we would be sending long strings and incrementing their length to see if and when the binary would break.

We usually utilize pre-defined wordlists of commonly used terms for each type of test for web fuzzing to see if the webserver would accept them. This is done because web servers do not usually provide a directory of all available links and domains (unless terribly configured), and so we would have to check for various links and see which ones return pages. For example, if we visit [https://www.hackthebox.eu/doesnotexist](https://www.hackthebox.eu/doesnotexist), we would get an HTTP code `404 Page Not Found`, and see the below page:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_HTB_404.jpg)

However, if we visit a page that exists, like `/login`, we would get the login page and get an HTTP code `200 OK`, and see the below page:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_HTB_login.jpg)

This is the basic idea behind web fuzzing for pages and directories. Still, we cannot do this manually, as it will take forever. This is why we have tools that do this automatically, efficiently, and very quickly. Such tools send hundreds of requests every second, study the response HTTP code, and determine whether the page exists or not. Thus, we can quickly determine what pages exist and then manually examine them to see their content.

* * *

## Wordlists

To determine which pages exist, we should have a wordlist containing commonly used words for web directories and pages, very similar to a `Password Dictionary Attack`, which we will discuss later in the module. Though this will not reveal all pages under a specific website, as some pages are randomly named or use unique names, in general, this returns the majority of pages, reaching up to 90% success rate on some websites.

We will not have to reinvent the wheel by manually creating these wordlists, as great efforts have been made to search the web and determine the most commonly used words for each type of fuzzing. Some of the most commonly used wordlists can be found under the GitHub [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) repository, which categorizes wordlists under various types of fuzzing, even including commonly used passwords, which we'll later utilize for Password Brute Forcing.

Within our PwnBox, we can find the entire `SecLists` repo available under `/opt/useful/SecLists`. The specific wordlist we will be utilizing for pages and directory fuzzing is another commonly used wordlist called `directory-list-2.3`, and it is available in various forms and sizes. We can find the one we will be using under:

```shell
locate directory-list-2.3-small.txt

/opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

```

Tip: Taking a look at this wordlist we will notice that it contains copyright comments at the beginning, which can be considered as part of the wordlist and clutter the results. We can use the following in `ffuf` to get rid of these lines with the `-ic` flag.


# Directory Fuzzing

* * *

Now that we understand the concept of Web Fuzzing and know our wordlist, we should be ready to start using `ffuf` to find website directories.

* * *

## Ffuf

`Ffuf` is pre-installed on your PwnBox instance. If you want to use it on your own machine, you can either use " `apt install ffuf -y`" or download it and use it from its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.git). As a new user of this tool, we will start by issuing the `ffuf -h` command to see how the tools can be used:

```shell
ffuf -h

HTTP OPTIONS:
  -H               Header `"Name: Value"`, separated by colon. Multiple -H flags are accepted.
  -X               HTTP method to use (default: GET)
  -b               Cookie data `"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2"` for copy as curl functionality.
  -d               POST data
  -recursion       Scan recursively. Only FUZZ keyword is supported, and URL (-u) has to end in it. (default: false)
  -recursion-depth Maximum recursion depth. (default: 0)
  -u               Target URL
...SNIP...

MATCHER OPTIONS:
  -mc              Match HTTP status codes, or "all" for everything. (default: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403)
  -ms              Match HTTP response size
...SNIP...

FILTER OPTIONS:
  -fc              Filter HTTP status codes from response. Comma separated list of codes and ranges
  -fs              Filter HTTP response size. Comma separated list of sizes and ranges
...SNIP...

INPUT OPTIONS:
...SNIP...
  -w               Wordlist file path and (optional) keyword separated by colon. eg. '/path/to/wordlist:KEYWORD'

OUTPUT OPTIONS:
  -o               Write output to file
...SNIP...

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  Fuzz file paths from wordlist.txt, match all responses but filter out those with content-size 42.
  Colored, verbose output.
    ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://example.org/FUZZ -mc all -fs 42 -c -v
...SNIP...

```

As we can see, the `help` output is quite large, so we only kept the options that may become relevant for us in this module.

* * *

## Directory Fuzzing

As we can see from the example above, the main two options are `-w` for wordlists and `-u` for the URL. We can assign a wordlist to a keyword to refer to it where we want to fuzz. For example, we can pick our wordlist and assign the keyword `FUZZ` to it by adding `:FUZZ` after it:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ

```

Next, as we want to be fuzzing for web directories, we can place the `FUZZ` keyword where the directory would be within our URL, with:

```shell
ffuf -w <SNIP> -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ

```

Now, let's start our target in the question below and run our final command on it:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

```

We see that `ffuf` tested for almost 90k URLs in less than 10 seconds. This speed may vary depending on your internet speed and ping if you used `ffuf` on your machine, but it should still be extremely fast.

We can even make it go faster if we are in a hurry by increasing the number of threads to 200, for example, with `-t 200`, but this is not recommended, especially when used on a remote site, as it may disrupt it, and cause a `Denial of Service`, or bring down your internet connection in severe cases. We do get a couple of hits, and we can visit one of them to verify that it exists:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_blog.jpg)

We get an empty page, indicating that the directory does not have a dedicated page, but also shows that we do have access to it, as we do not get an HTTP code `404 Not Found` or `403 Access Denied`. In the next section, we will look for pages under this directory to see whether it is really empty or has hidden files and pages.


# Page Fuzzing

* * *

We now understand the basic use of `ffuf` through the utilization of wordlists and keywords. Next, we will learn how to locate pages.

Note: We can spawn the same target from the previous section for this section's examples as well.

* * *

## Extension Fuzzing

In the previous section, we found that we had access to `/blog`, but the directory returned an empty page, and we cannot manually locate any links or pages. So, we will once again utilize web fuzzing to see if the directory contains any hidden pages. However, before we start, we must find out what types of pages the website uses, like `.html`, `.aspx`, `.php`, or something else.

One common way to identify that is by finding the server type through the HTTP response headers and guessing the extension. For example, if the server is `apache`, then it may be `.php`, or if it was `IIS`, then it could be `.asp` or `.aspx`, and so on. This method is not very practical, though. So, we will again utilize `ffuf` to fuzz the extension, similar to how we fuzzed for directories. Instead of placing the `FUZZ` keyword where the directory name would be, we would place it where the extension would be `.FUZZ`, and use a wordlist for common extensions. We can utilize the following wordlist in `SecLists` for extensions:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ <SNIP>

```

Before we start fuzzing, we must specify which file that extension would be at the end of! We can always use two wordlists and have a unique keyword for each, and then do `FUZZ_1.FUZZ_2` to fuzz for both. However, there is one file we can always find in most websites, which is `index.*`, so we will use it as our file and fuzz extensions on it.

Note: The wordlist we chose already contains a dot (.), so we will not have to add the dot after "index" in our fuzzing.

Now, we can rerun our command, carefully placing our `FUZZ` keyword where the extension would be after `index`:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/indexFUZZ

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

```

We do get a couple of hits, but only `.php` gives us a response with code `200`.
Great! We now know that this website runs on `PHP` to start fuzzing for `PHP` files.

* * *

## Page Fuzzing

We will now use the same concept of keywords we've been using with `ffuf`, use `.php` as the extension, place our `FUZZ` keyword where the filename should be, and use the same wordlist we used for fuzzing directories:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/FUZZ.php

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

       v1.1.0-git
________________________________________________

```

We get a couple of hits; both have an HTTP code 200, meaning we can access them. index.php has a size of 0, indicating that it is an empty page, while the other does not, which means that it has content. We can visit any of these pages to verify this:

# Recursive Fuzzing

* * *

So far, we have been fuzzing for directories, then going under these directories, and then fuzzing for files. However, if we had dozens of directories, each with their own subdirectories and files, this would take a very long time to complete. To be able to automate this, we will utilize what is known as `recursive fuzzing`.

* * *

## Recursive Flags

When we scan recursively, it automatically starts another scan under any newly identified directories that may have on their pages until it has fuzzed the main website and all of its subdirectories.

Some websites may have a big tree of sub-directories, like `/login/user/content/uploads/...etc`, and this will expand the scanning tree and may take a very long time to scan them all. This is why it is always advised to specify a `depth` to our recursive scan, such that it will not scan directories that are deeper than that depth. Once we fuzz the first directories, we can then pick the most interesting directories and run another scan to direct our scan better.

In `ffuf`, we can enable recursive scanning with the `-recursion` flag, and we can specify the depth with the `-recursion-depth` flag. If we specify `-recursion-depth 1`, it will only fuzz the main directories and their direct sub-directories. If any sub-sub-directories are identified (like `/login/user`, it will not fuzz them for pages). When using recursion in `ffuf`, we can specify our extension with `-e .php`

Note: we can still use \`.php\` as our page extension, as these extensions are usually site-wide.

Finally, we will also add the flag `-v` to output the full URLs. Otherwise, it may be difficult to tell which `.php` file lies under which directory.

* * *

## Recursive Scanning

Let us repeat the first command we used, add the recursion flags to it while specifying `.php` as our extension, and see what results we get:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

       v1.1.0-git

```

As we can see this time, the scan took much longer, sent almost six times the number of requests, and the wordlist doubled in size (once with `.php` and once without). Still, we got a large number of results, including all the results we previously identified, all with a single line of command.


# DNS Records

* * *

Once we accessed the page under `/blog`, we got a message saying `Admin panel moved to academy.htb`. If we visit the website in our browser, we get `canât connect to the server at www.academy.htb`:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_cant_connect_academy.jpg)

This is because the exercises we do are not public websites that can be accessed by anyone but local websites within HTB. Browsers only understand how to go to IPs, and if we provide them with a URL, they try to map the URL to an IP by looking into the local `/etc/hosts` file and the public DNS `Domain Name System`. If the URL is not in either, it would not know how to connect to it.

If we visit the IP directly, the browser goes to that IP directly and knows how to connect to it. But in this case, we tell it to go to `academy.htb`, so it looks into the local `/etc/hosts` file and doesn't find any mention of it. It asks the public DNS about it (such as Google's DNS `8.8.8.8`) and does not find any mention of it, since it is not a public website, and eventually fails to connect. So, to connect to `academy.htb`, we would have to add it to our `/etc/hosts` file. We can achieve that with the following command:

```shell
sudo sh -c 'echo "SERVER_IP  academy.htb" >> /etc/hosts'

```

Now we can visit the website (don't forget to add the PORT in the URL) and see that we can reach the website:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_main_site.jpg)

However, we get the same website we got when we visit the IP directly, so `academy.htb` is the same domain we have been testing so far. We can verify that by visiting `/blog/index.php`, and see that we can access the page.

When we run our tests on this IP, we did not find anything about `admin` or panels, even when we did a full `recursive` scan on our target. `So, in this case, we start looking for sub-domains under '*.academy.htb' and see if we find anything, which is what we will attempt in the next section.`


# Sub-domain Fuzzing

* * *

In this section, we will learn how to use `ffuf` to identify sub-domains (i.e., `*.website.com`) for any website.

* * *

## Sub-domains

A sub-domain is any website underlying another domain. For example, `https://photos.google.com` is the `photos` sub-domain of `google.com`.

In this case, we are simply checking different websites to see if they exist by checking if they have a public DNS record that would redirect us to a working server IP. So, let's run a scan and see if we get any hits. Before we can start our scan, we need two things:

- A `wordlist`
- A `target`

Luckily for us, in the `SecLists` repo, there is a specific section for sub-domain wordlists, consisting of common words usually used for sub-domains. We can find it in `/opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/`. In our case, we would be using a shorter wordlist, which is `subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`. If we want to extend our scan, we can pick a larger list.

As for our target, we will use `inlanefreight.com` as our target and run our scan on it. Let us use `ffuf` and place the `FUZZ` keyword in the place of sub-domains, and see if we get any hits:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.inlanefreight.com/

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

We see that we do get a few hits back. Now, we can try running the same thing on `academy.htb` and see if we get any hits back:

We see that we do not get any hits back. Does this mean that there are no sub-domain under `academy.htb`? \- No.

This means that there are no `public` sub-domains under `academy.htb`, as it does not have a public DNS record, as previously mentioned. Even though we did add `academy.htb` to our `/etc/hosts` file, we only added the main domain, so when `ffuf` is looking for other sub-domains, it will not find them in `/etc/hosts`, and will ask the public DNS, which obviously will not have them.


# Vhost Fuzzing

* * *

As we saw in the previous section, we were able to fuzz public sub-domains using public DNS records. However, when it came to fuzzing sub-domains that do not have a public DNS record or sub-domains under websites that are not public, we could not use the same method. In this section, we will learn how to do that with `Vhost Fuzzing`.

* * *

## Vhosts vs. Sub-domains

The key difference between VHosts and sub-domains is that a VHost is basically a 'sub-domain' served on the same server and has the same IP, such that a single IP could be serving two or more different websites.

`VHosts may or may not have public DNS records.`

In many cases, many websites would actually have sub-domains that are not public and will not publish them in public DNS records, and hence if we visit them in a browser, we would fail to connect, as the public DNS would not know their IP. Once again, if we use the `sub-domain fuzzing`, we would only be able to identify public sub-domains but will not identify any sub-domains that are not public.

This is where we utilize `VHosts Fuzzing` on an IP we already have. We will run a scan and test for scans on the same IP, and then we will be able to identify both public and non-public sub-domains and VHosts.

* * *

## Vhosts Fuzzing

To scan for VHosts, without manually adding the entire wordlist to our `/etc/hosts`, we will be fuzzing HTTP headers, specifically the `Host: ` header. To do that, we can use the `-H` flag to specify a header and will use the `FUZZ` keyword within it, as follows:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb'

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

<...SNIP...>

```

We see that all words in the wordlist are returning `200 OK`! This is expected, as we are simply changing the header while visiting `http://academy.htb:PORT/`. So, we know that we will always get `200 OK`. However, if the VHost does exist and we send a correct one in the header, we should get a different response size, as in that case, we would be getting the page from that VHosts, which is likely to show a different page.


# Filtering Results

* * *

So far, we have not been using any filtering to our `ffuf`, and the results are automatically filtered by default by their HTTP code, which filters out code `404 NOT FOUND`, and keeps the rest. However, as we saw in our previous run of `ffuf`, we can get many responses with code `200`. So, in this case, we will have to filter the results based on another factor, which we will learn in this section.

* * *

## Filtering

`Ffuf` provides the option to match or filter out a specific HTTP code, response size, or amount of words. We can see that with `ffuf -h`:

```shell
ffuf -h
...SNIP...
MATCHER OPTIONS:
  -mc              Match HTTP status codes, or "all" for everything. (default: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403)
  -ml              Match amount of lines in response
  -mr              Match regexp
  -ms              Match HTTP response size
  -mw              Match amount of words in response

FILTER OPTIONS:
  -fc              Filter HTTP status codes from response. Comma separated list of codes and ranges
  -fl              Filter by amount of lines in response. Comma separated list of line counts and ranges
  -fr              Filter regexp
  -fs              Filter HTTP response size. Comma separated list of sizes and ranges
  -fw              Filter by amount of words in response. Comma separated list of word counts and ranges
<...SNIP...>

```

In this case, we cannot use matching, as we don't know what the response size from other VHosts would be. We know the response size of the incorrect results, which, as seen from the test above, is `900`, and we can filter it out with `-fs 900`. Now, let's repeat the same previous command, add the above flag, and see what we get:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' -fs 900

       /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

```

We can verify that by visiting the page, and seeing if we can connect to it:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_blog.jpg)

Note 1: Don't forget to add "admin.academy.htb" to "/etc/hosts".

Note 2: If your exercise has been restarted, ensure you still have the correct port when visiting the website.

We see that we can access the page, but we get an empty page, unlike what we got with `academy.htb`, therefore confirming this is indeed a different VHost. We can even visit `https://admin.academy.htb:PORT/blog/index.php`, and we will see that we would get a `404 PAGE NOT FOUND`, confirming that we are now indeed on a different VHost.

Try running a recursive scan on `admin.academy.htb`, and see what pages you can identify.


# Parameter Fuzzing - GET

* * *

If we run a recursive `ffuf` scan on `admin.academy.htb`, we should find `http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php`. If we try accessing this page, we see the following:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_admin.jpg)

That indicates that there must be something that identifies users to verify whether they have access to read the `flag`. We did not login, nor do we have any cookie that can be verified at the backend. So, perhaps there is a key that we can pass to the page to read the `flag`. Such keys would usually be passed as a `parameter`, using either a `GET` or a `POST` HTTP request. This section will discuss how to fuzz for such parameters until we identify a parameter that can be accepted by the page.

**Tip:** Fuzzing parameters may expose unpublished parameters that are publicly accessible. Such parameters tend to be less tested and less secured, so it is important to test such parameters for the web vulnerabilities we discuss in other modules.

* * *

## GET Request Fuzzing

Similarly to how we have been fuzzing various parts of a website, we will use `ffuf` to enumerate parameters. Let us first start with fuzzing for `GET` requests, which are usually passed right after the URL, with a `?` symbol, like:

- `http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php?param1=key`.

So, all we have to do is replace `param1` in the example above with `FUZZ` and rerun our scan. Before we can start, however, we must pick an appropriate wordlist. Once again, `SecLists` has just that in `/opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt`. With that, we can run our scan.

Once again, we will get many results back, so we will filter out the default response size we are getting.

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php?FUZZ=key -fs xxx

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

       v1.1.0-git
________________________________________________

 :: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php?FUZZ=key

________________________________________________

<...SNIP...>                    [Status: xxx, Size: xxx, Words: xxx, Lines: xxx]

```

We do get a hit back. Let us try to visit the page and add this `GET` parameter, and see whether we can read the flag now:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_admin_param1.jpg)

As we can see, the only hit we got back has been `deprecated` and appears to be no longer in use.


# Parameter Fuzzing - POST

* * *

The main difference between `POST` requests and `GET` requests is that `POST` requests are not passed with the URL and cannot simply be appended after a `?` symbol. `POST` requests are passed in the `data` field within the HTTP request. Check out the [Web Requests](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/35) module to learn more about HTTP requests.

To fuzz the `data` field with `ffuf`, we can use the `-d` flag, as we saw previously in the output of `ffuf -h`. We also have to add `-X POST` to send `POST` requests.

Tip: In PHP, "POST" data "content-type" can only accept "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". So, we can set that in "ffuf" with "-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'".

So, let us repeat what we did earlier, but place our `FUZZ` keyword after the `-d` flag:

```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'FUZZ=key' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs xxx

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

       v1.1.0-git
________________________________________________

 :: Method           : POST
 :: URL              : http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php

________________________________________________

id                      [Status: xxx, Size: xxx, Words: xxx, Lines: xxx]
<...SNIP...>

```

As we can see this time, we got a couple of hits, the same one we got when fuzzing `GET` and another parameter, which is `id`. Let's see what we get if we send a `POST` request with the `id` parameter. We can do that with `curl`, as follows:

```shell
curl http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=key' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'

<div class='center'><p>Invalid id!</p></div>
<...SNIP...>

```

As we can see, the message now says `Invalid id!`.


# Value Fuzzing

* * *

After fuzzing a working parameter, we now have to fuzz the correct value that would return the `flag` content we need. This section will discuss fuzzing for parameter values, which should be fairly similar to fuzzing for parameters, once we develop our wordlist.

* * *

## Custom Wordlist

When it comes to fuzzing parameter values, we may not always find a pre-made wordlist that would work for us, as each parameter would expect a certain type of value.

For some parameters, like usernames, we can find a pre-made wordlist for potential usernames, or we may create our own based on users that may potentially be using the website. For such cases, we can look for various wordlists under the `seclists` directory and try to find one that may contain values matching the parameter we are targeting. In other cases, like custom parameters, we may have to develop our own wordlist. In this case, we can guess that the `id` parameter can accept a number input of some sort. These ids can be in a custom format, or can be sequential, like from 1-1000 or 1-1000000, and so on. We'll start with a wordlist containing all numbers from 1-1000.

There are many ways to create this wordlist, from manually typing the IDs in a file, or scripting it using Bash or Python. The simplest way is to use the following command in Bash that writes all numbers from 1-1000 to a file:

```shell
for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i >> ids.txt; done

```

Once we run our command, we should have our wordlist ready:

```shell
cat ids.txt

1
2
3
4
5
6
<...SNIP...>

```

Now we can move on to fuzzing for values.

* * *

## Value Fuzzing

Our command should be fairly similar to the `POST` command we used to fuzz for parameters, but our `FUZZ` keyword should be put where the parameter value would be, and we will use the `ids.txt` wordlist we just created, as follows:

```shell
ffuf -w ids.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs xxx

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

       v1.0.2
________________________________________________

 :: Method           : POST
 :: URL              : http://admin.academy.htb:30794/admin/admin.php
 :: Header           : Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 :: Data             : id=FUZZ
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403
 :: Filter           : Response size: xxx
________________________________________________

<...SNIP...>                      [Status: xxx, Size: xxx, Words: xxx, Lines: xxx]

```

We see that we get a hit right away. We can finally send another `POST` request using `curl`, as we did in the previous section, use the `id` value we just found, and collect the flag.


# Skills Assessment - Web Fuzzing

* * *

You are given an online academy's IP address but have no further information about their website. As the first step of conducting a Penetration Test, you are expected to locate all pages and domains linked to their IP to enumerate the IP and domains properly.

Finally, you should do some fuzzing on pages you identify to see if any of them has any parameters that can be interacted with. If you do find active parameters, see if you can retrieve any data from them.
